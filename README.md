# StoryStarter
An app that randomly generates stories for people with writers block.

(Ali from the future here - this was a project I built the summer after my sophomore year of high school. I was hot off my first hackathon season and wanted to learn more about programming logic which I for some reason thought was called "coming up with algorithms". I asked some non-STEM friends for app ideas to build for them and this one came up! Taught me about DOM manipulation and how to use Math.random() lol so that was cool I guess.)
